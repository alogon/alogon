Welcome!

I'm an experimenter with a penchant for building things that interest me. This has taken the form of teaching myself to knit, playing guitar, baking sourdough, and creating applications to speed up my work processes. I am the master of the side story, but I can usually find my way back to the point!

I was born in Texas long enough ago to know that it wasn't Red.
