# Howdy! I'm Scott.

I'm an experimenter with a penchant for building things that interest me. This has taken the form of teaching myself to knit, playing guitar, baking sourdough, and creating applications to speed up my work processes. I am the master of the side story, but I can usually find my way back to the point!

I was born in Texas long enough ago to know that it wasn't Red.

## Projects
### 1. **bedrock-evaluations**
This project is designed to create a comprehensive evaluation system for AWS course content using Amazon Bedrock. It focuses on evaluating course materials across five key metrics: Completeness, Correctness, Content Organization, Technical Depth, and Clarity of Explanations. The system includes a web dashboard for visualizing evaluation results, CloudFormation templates for infrastructure deployment, and JSONL configuration files for defining evaluation criteria. The project appears to be set up to compare different LLM performance and track course quality over time with domain-specific categorization.

### 3. **course-analogies-generator**
This is a conceptual project in its early stages, containing only an idea document. The project aims to create a system that takes generated course content and creates alternative explanations using analogies from different domains like cooking, music, or residential neighborhoods. This would help make technical AWS concepts more accessible by relating them to familiar, everyday experiences.

### 4. **course-placeholders**
This project is focused on extracting and managing placeholder text from course translation files. It contains a Python script that parses XLIFF (XML Localization Interchange File Format) files to identify and list all placeholder text that needs to be replaced during the localization process. The project appears to be part of a larger course translation workflow, helping to identify content that requires specific handling during the translation process.

### 5. **demo-steps-to-pptx**
This appears to be a minimal project containing only a PowerPoint presentation file, likely serving as a template or example for converting demonstration steps into presentation format.

### 6. **gp-course-content-generator**
This project represents an earlier iteration or status document for the AWS Course Content Generator workflow. Based on the project status document, it was designed to automatically generate course content for AWS services using Step Functions orchestration, including main content, riser files, demos, and DDR files. The project has evolved significantly and appears to have been superseded by the more comprehensive `gp-course-gen-workflow` project.

This project explores using AWS Bedrock to enhance the course content generation workflow. It's a more focused implementation that leverages foundation models, knowledge bases, and orchestrated workflows to create high-quality AWS service training content. The project includes comprehensive documentation, Python scripts for different generation tasks, prompt templates, and support for knowledge base integration. It appears to be a more advanced, Bedrock-focused approach to course generation compared to the main workflow project.

### 8. **improve-gs-course**
This is a sophisticated serverless system called "Course Narrative Analyzer" that analyzes the narrative coherence of AWS training courses using natural language processing and machine learning. The system uses AWS Bedrock for deep narrative analysis, evaluates course structure against successful patterns, and generates actionable improvement recommendations. It includes a complete CDK-based infrastructure, API Gateway endpoints, and comprehensive analysis capabilities including coherence scoring, story arc analysis, and thematic consistency evaluation.

### 9. **migrate-resources-new-region**
This is a utility project containing a single Python script designed to migrate AWS Bedrock Prompt Management assets between regions. It's a focused tool for handling the migration of prompt-related resources when moving AWS infrastructure to different regions.

### 10. **s3-sync**
This is a simple utility project for synchronizing files with Amazon S3, containing a Python script and environment configuration for S3 operations.
