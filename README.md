# 👋 Howdy! I'm Scott.

I'm a creative technologist blending code, art, and music to build things that are both functional and expressive. I thrive on solving complex problems with elegant solutions and I think it's pretty cool when tech meets storytelling.

## 🔧 What I Do

- 🎨 Creative problem-solving with a technical twist
- 🧠 AI workflows using Bedrock, Neptune, and custom pipelines
- 🎵 Music + art projects that explore generative creativity
- 🚀 Entrepreneurial experiments in niche markets & recurring revenue

## 🌍 Currently Exploring

- 🔄 Building generation pipelines with JSON-based course creation
- 🇬🇧 Exploring knowledge graph solutions to enhance LLM capabilities
- 🧪 Prototyping ideas that merge artistic intuition with machine learning

## 📌 Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| [ 🚠 Riser](https://github.com/alogon/riser) | My first production script! It was basically "Legos". I knew what I needed it to do, so I searched for each piece online. "Open file 1 (JSON), open file 2 (XLIFF), replace string in file 2 with string from file 1, repeat 147 times". It's actually a much cooler win than it sounds. Replaced a ⏰ 12-to-18 hour manual process with an hour of doc prep. Tip o' the hat to esteemed RK for the seed that opened the door to this gamechanger! | Python, Articulate Rise |
| [ 🏭 AI Course Generator](https://github.com/alogon/ai-course-generator) | Scalable 🏭 pipeline to generate course content for digital training courses. Reduced intial course production time from 10 days to (literally) ⏰ 3-to-5 minutes.  | Bedrock, Claude, Lambda, Step Functions, S3, Amplify, React, Python |
| [ 📈 What's New](https://github.com/yourusername/insightviz) | Web dashboard for tracking service updates and provide insight as to when a service has changed "enough" to warrant a major update to the relevant courses. | Lambda, Amplify, React, Python, RSS |
| [ 🧐 TDKG](https://github.com/alogon/tdkg) | Ingest up-to-date documentation into knowledge graph system to ensure course content reflects current state of course topic.  | Neptune, S3, Amplify, React, Python |
| [ ⚖️ Generated Content Evaluation](https://github.com/alogon/course-evaluation) | Comprehensive evaluation system for generated course content using Amazon Bedrock across five key metrics: Completeness, Correctness, Content Organization, Technical Depth, and Clarity of Explanations. Web dashboard for visualizing evaluation results and JSONL configuration files for defining ⚖️ evaluation criteria. Compares performance of 🧐 LLM used for generation against a second LLM. Tracks course quality over time with domain-specific categorization. | Bedrock, Claude, Nova, Llama, Amplify, React, Python |
| [ 🆎 Course Analogies Generator](https://github.com/alogon/analogies) | A system to generate alternative explanations using analogies for 👩🏽‍🔬 technical concepts from different domains like 👩🏽‍🍳 cooking, 🎵 music, or 🏘️ residential neighborhoods. Makes concepts more accessible by relating them to familiar, everyday experiences. | Bedrock, S3, Python |
| [ 🤔 Improve Course Narrative](https://github.com/alogon/narrative) | Analyze the narrative coherence of 🚞 training courses using 🗣️natural language processing and 🤖 machine learning. Performs deep narrative analysis, evaluates course structure against successful patterns, and generates actionable improvement recommendations. System provides comprehensive analysis capabilities including coherence scoring, story arc analysis, and thematic consistency evaluation | Bedrock, CDK, API Gateway, Lambda, S3, Python |
